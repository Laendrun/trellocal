# Trellocal

Trellocal is a try at creating a Trello clone taht works entirely locally.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a Trello clone that works entirely locally, without the need for a server. This is to avoid the need to create an account and to avoid the need to have an internet connection.
One of my friends asked if I knew of a Trello clone that works locally, and I didn't, so I decided to make one.
It's also a good way to learn how to use Electron and get better at using CSS.

## Installation

For now, you can't install Trellocal. You can clone the repository and run it locally in development mode.
Later, I will create a release and you will be able to download it from the releases page.

### Development

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Production

Not available yet.

## Usage

### Development

Run `npm run start` to start the application.

### Production

Not available yet.
